# Domain Information

## Domain Puchasing

Domain of choise for attacks is crucial if no CDN is used for C2 Redirector servers or no domain fronting is possible due to X, Y, Z reasons.&#x20;

* **https://expireddomains.com** - Domains which have expired or are on the marketplace for sale are listed. Good for identifying old domains that can be bought for cheap to host a benign website or a clone of an existing one. (Can also be used for phishing depending on the target)

## Domain Reputation

Domain reputation classifies if automated reputation checking tools are used by the target. These can trigger on newly purchased domains which were not catergorized or have a bad reputation.

Automated checking systems can alert on things such as:

* Bad domain reputation
* Newly purchased domain
* Domain categorization
* Blacklisted domains

When a defense system is triggered, connection will likely be dropped or at least the necessary defense team will be alerted of connections made to unreputable domains.
